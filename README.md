## Data analysis
### Using Python
#### [Weather analysis using Sensebox API](https://github.com/violetasdev/projects_overview/blob/master/sensebox/Sensebox_PartA.ipynb)
In this project, I retrieved data from the OpenSenseMap API, using SQLite for data analysis in a Jupyter Notebook. The main focus is to analyse diverse weather variables to establish the most insightful ones for evaluating soil health in the GC Westerholt golf course.

### Using R
#### [Spatial Data Science with R](https://github.com/violetasdev/SDR_geotech)
Solutions to the course assignments in R. I explore diverse libraries to analyse spatial data. 

As the final project, **I developed an R package** that reviews the first steps for implementing a Spectral Solution following the algorithm described by Marius Leordeanu. Google's PageRank algorithm is used for the scoring process. The objective is to optimize the pair selection in matching features for Similarity Matrices. The input is the Similarity Matrices generated between two sets of features, Sketchmap and Metricmap. Finally, a short comparison is made between different technologies.
